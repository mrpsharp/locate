[MyGridRef.uk](https://mygridref.uk) is a simple webapp which uses your phone GPS to find your six number UK grid reference and give you the option to share it. I created this in response to the withdrawal of OS Locate which created a gap in the market for a simple way to find your grid reference. I was also inspired by [What3Words Locate](https://locate.what3words.com), a similar application for What3Words.

If you want to check the gridreference is sensible, you can use the [testing](https://mygridref.uk/?testing) link which gives you an option to open your reported location in OS maps. Double-check the grid reference on the web page matched the one you have on the web app.

The project is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/mrpsharp/mygridref.uk). If you find problems please let me know through [Github Issues](https://github.com/mrpsharp/mygridref.uk/issues) or [get in touch](https://petersharp.education/contact/).
